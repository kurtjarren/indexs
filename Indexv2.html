<h1>Christmas Letter</h1>
<h3>Dear Mom,<br>
I just want to take a moment to say thank you—for everything. Words cannot fully express how grateful I am for all the love, care, and sacrifices you’ve made for me. You’ve been my rock, my cheerleader, and my biggest source of inspiration.</h3>

<h3>Thank you for always being there, no matter what. For your hugs when I needed comfort, your wisdom when I felt lost, and your patience even when I made mistakes. I know that everything you do comes from a place of love, and I want you to know that I see it and cherish it deeply.</h3>

<h3>You’ve taught me the values of kindness, resilience, and hard work, and I carry those lessons with me every day. I’m so lucky to have you as my mom, and I hope you know how much I love and appreciate you.</h3>

<h3>I promise to do my best to make you proud and to give back even just a fraction of the love and care you’ve given me. Thank you for being you—the most amazing mom anyone could ask for.</h3>

<h3>With all my love,<br>
Kurt Jarren Mirasol❤️</h3>
